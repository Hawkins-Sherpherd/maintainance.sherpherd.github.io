title: Indefinite peer shutdown of US-LAX1
---
Due to frequent crash of routing daemon on US-LAX1, I decide to migrate US-LAX1 to a more powerful VPS in future.
Before the migration have done, all peering with US-LAX1 will remain shutdown, when it has done, the network information of new US-LAX1 node will be announced. The one using domain name as endpoint (us-lax1.dn42.sherpherd.net) may seamlessly migrate its connection without configuration change.

**Start Time**
May 5, 2024, 21:00(UTC +8)

**Estimated End Time**
Indetermined

**Affected Network Operation:**
All peering with SERNET US-LAX1

**Potential Influences to DN42 Network:**
Temporary traffic interrupt
